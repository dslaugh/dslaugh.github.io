# Golf Cart Rating App

I created this to help me choose good golf carts and avoid bad ones for the golf league I belong to.

It was written using only vanilla javascript, html, and css.

All carts are not created equal.
There's nothing worse than getting your clubs all loaded up in a cart and heading off
to the first tee only to discover that the cart you got is a weak turd that pulls constantly to the left.

I created this app to help me avoid these turds.
